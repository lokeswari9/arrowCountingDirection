You are given a string representing a sequence of N arrows, each pointing
in one of the four cardinal directions: up ('^), down (v), left (Â«') or right
(">).
Write a function solution that, given a string S denoting the directions
of the arrows, returns the minimum number of arrows that must be
rotated to make them all point in the same direction.
Examples:
1. Given S = "v<v", the function should return 2. After rotating both the
first ('^) and fourth ('") arrows downwards (v), all of the arrows would
point down.
2. Given S = "v>>>W", the function should return 3. After rotating the first,
fifth and sixth arrow rightwards, all of the arrows would point right.
3. Given S = "<<<" the function should return 0. All of the arrows already
point left.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..100];
string S consists only of the following characters: "^", "V",
<" and/or">
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution
will not be the focus of the assessment.
